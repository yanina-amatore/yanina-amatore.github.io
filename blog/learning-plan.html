          <!-- question 1 -->
          <h2 class="h2">What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p class="blog-p"> I want my career pathway to ultimately lead me to a job that keeps me excited daily. I'd also like the flexibility of working remotely to spend time travelling and visiting family overseas.
          One essential thing to me is to enjoy each step of the developer journey, starting from studying in Dev Academy. </p>
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <h2 class="h2">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h2>
          <p class="blog-p"> About my strengths, I put in the hours, commit to studying, and ensure I fully understand what I'm learning. 
            If I'm unsure about what I have to do, I search for the answer and reach out to others for help if I need to.     
          </p>

          </p>       
          <p class="blog-p">Regarding my limitations, I've been out of practice from studying for quite some years, so It is taking me some time to adjust to the rhythm and stick to the timeboxes.
            Also, a limitation might be splitting my attention between caring for my baby and studying. I'm finding it hard to concentrate at home during foundations. I'm constantly hiding from my crying child, which saddens me and slows me down in my studies. I hope that improves when I start Bootcamp as I'll be away from home.</p>
          <!-- question 3 -->
          <h2 class="h2"> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h2>
          <p class="blog-p">I look forward to learning more about myself and building my confidence in my strengths through this journey. I'd also love to continue learning and developing studying/working techniques that consider our well-being, as I'll need them during my whole career pathway.</p>

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:            
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives and What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.

            To balance my parenting and learning, I already have some plans for Foundations and Bootcamp.
            While in foundations, I'm splitting my work into blocks of hours and shuffling my parenting responsibilities around them. I aim to study no less than 40 hours per week and spare a weekend day to enjoy my family.
            For the Bootcamp, I've arranged with my partner to cover the daily daycare drop-off and pick-up so I could work uninterrupted for longer.
            Communication is vital to working productively with others. I plan to keep my team and facilitator informed of my schedule and use the appropriate discord status when logged in. 
            
            Regarding what I plan to do when things get complicated, I plan to take a step back, have a break, and consider possible solutions. I'll assess if I can solve the problem on my own or if I need help from others. I'll reach out to my facilitator and have a talk about it as I'm sure they've been through something similar or have helped someone with the same.
            I'm also planning to care about my well-being by exercising. Last year I suffered from postpartum depression, and exercising was vital in my recovery, so I want to keep myself as active as possible.

            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
          </h2>  
          <p class="blog-p">
            I plan to ask for help using the appropriate discord channels during foundations and ask for help from the facilitators and other students in person during Bootcamp. Although I want to find the solution on my own, I promise not to go down the rabbit hole and waste too much time if I don't see the answer. I can ask the question and still explore a solution and then compare. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2">
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

            I have a year-old baby, so I have some parenting commitments.
            I plan to drop her off at daycare at 8am from Wednesdays to Fridays. Her daycare is close to the Dev academy campus, so I'll do it before class.
            I'd also like to bathe her and put her to bed daily, so I won't be online after returning from Bootcamp until 7.30/8pm. I'll communicate this to my team colleagues if I must complete work after class.
            Also, six months ago, I booked an orthodontist consultation, and the closest date they gave me was 4th August at 9am. It's in The Terrace, so I plan to go there before Bootcamp and rush to class after it.
            I've heard about how intense Bootcamp weeks are, but I'd like to manage to be offline at least half a day during the weekend to spend with my kid. I hope this is something I can negotiate with my colleagues if I'm working in a team. I'll need to spend quality time with my daughter for my well-being and hers.
