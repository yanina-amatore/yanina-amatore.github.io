          <h2 class="h2">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">I love action sci/fi movies, so to explain how JavaScript relates to HTML and CSS, I chose an analogy about how these films making processes.  </p>
          <p class="blog-p">At the beginning of the movie production, writers create a story in a documented script which describes all the characters and scenes to be performed. This would be the HTML part of the movie, let's say. If the actors performed just what was written in that text without any extra aid, it would look more like a minimalistic theatre play than an actual action movie.
            </p>
          <p class="blog-p">But to properly tell a story, we need more context that could be provided by adding styling. This is when the director would hire CSS as a designer. It would be in charge of how the elements (characters, props and film sets) will look on the screen. It can manipulate and style them in fancy costumes, add make-up and even change the backgrounds for different scenes.  </p>
          <p class="blog-p">However, It cannot be a sci-fi movie if no special effects are involved. In this analogy, JS would be the post-production movie team in charge of adding CGI (computer-generated imagery) and other special effects to our movie. For example, they could take an element of the film like the actor Mark Ruffalo playing Hulk and make him look big, green and angry or make Thor fly onscreen when spinning his hammer fast. Likewise, JS working along HTML and CSS is used to dynamically change a page's behaviour, display and interactions.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Hope youâ€™ve enjoyed the analogy.</p>
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">Control flow is how your computer reads and runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line unless it hits any statement that changes the program's control flow (loops, conditionals, or functions). These mentioned loops repeatedly run a code block until a specific condition is met. Only then the computer will jump to read the following line. To understand it better, let's check an everyday example.</p> 
          <p class="blog-p">These days that I'm doing dev academy, my partner is the designated house cook. To make life easy, we decided to do Hello Fresh( a meal delivery service with pre-packed ingredients and portions). To successfully cook their meals, he must read and follow the recipes instructions from top to bottom like using control flow, or we might end up with a failed dinner. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">If we Apply the control flow and loops concepts, the recipe steps will look like this:</p>
