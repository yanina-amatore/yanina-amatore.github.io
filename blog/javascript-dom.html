          <!-- question 1 -->
          <h2 class="h2">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">I love action sci/fi movies, so to explain how  JavaScript relates to HTML and CSS, I chose an analogy about how most of these movies are made. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">At the beginning of the movie production,  writers create a story in a documented script which describes all the characters and scenes to be performed. This would be the HTML part of the movie, let's say. If the actors performed just what was written in that text without any extra aid, it would look more like a minimalistic theatre play than an actual action movie.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">But to properly tell a story, we need more context. So now, a styling team puts the actors in character, which helps to tell the story properly. This is when the director would hire CSS to take care of the whole movie styling. It would be in charge of how the elements (characters, props and film sets) will look on the screen. It can manipulate and style them in fancy costumes and make-up and even change the background.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">However, It is not a sci-fi movie if no special effects are involved. This would be a Java Script job. JS  would be the wizard in charge of interacting with the elements of the screen and creating visual/audio effects. It could interact with existing features or create new ones and change their style post-production.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Hope youâ€™ve enjoyed the analogy.</p>
          <!-- question 2 -->
