          <h2 class="h2">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">I love action sci/fi movies, so to explain how JavaScript relates to HTML and CSS, I chose an analogy about how these films making processes.  </p>
          <p class="blog-p">At the beginning of the movie production, writers create a story in a documented script which describes all the characters and scenes to be performed. This would be the HTML part of the movie, let's say. If the actors performed just what was written in that text without any extra aid, it would look more like a minimalistic theatre play than an actual action movie.
            </p>
          <p class="blog-p">But to properly tell a story, we need more context that could be provided by adding styling. This is when the director would hire CSS as a designer. It would be in charge of how the elements (characters, props and film sets) will look on the screen. It can manipulate and style them in fancy costumes, add make-up and even change the backgrounds for different scenes.  </p>
          <p class="blog-p">However, It cannot be a sci-fi movie if no special effects are involved. In this analogy, JS would be the post-production movie team in charge of adding CGI (computer-generated imagery) and other special effects to our movie. For example, they could take an element of the film like the actor Mark Ruffalo playing Hulk and make him look big, green and angry or make Thor fly onscreen when spinning his hammer fast. Likewise, JS working along HTML and CSS is used to dynamically change a page's behaviour, display and interactions.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Hope you’ve enjoyed the analogy.</p>
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">Control flow is how your computer reads and runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line unless it hits any statement that changes the program's control flow (loops, conditionals, or functions). These mentioned loops repeatedly run a code block until a specific condition is met. Only then the computer will jump to read the following line. To understand it better, let's check an everyday example.</p> 
          <p class="blog-p">These days that I'm doing dev academy, my partner is the designated house cook. To make life easy, we decided to do Hello Fresh( a meal delivery service with pre-packed ingredients and portions). To successfully cook their meals, he must read and follow the recipes instructions from top to bottom like using control flow, or we might end up with a failed dinner. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">If we Apply the control flow and loops concepts, the recipe steps will look like this:</p>

          <h2 class="h2">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h2>
          <p class="blog-p">The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It can simply be understood as a tree of nodes created by the browser. t's like a family tree, except each object, method, or property has only one parent. Each of the nodes has its own properties and methods which can be manipulated using JavaScript.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Image</p>
          <p class="blog-p">The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.
            In the example below the getElementById() method used to find the element  "div id="byId" and modify it.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">I made a simple  webpage  in VS code and   then open  it in the browser and inspect it using the Dev Tools.
            In the elements tab we can see the HTML  tree like page organization mentioned before and in the style box and  we can see the styling properties that have been applied using css. In this case the text  attribute  color:blue has been applied to all the text nested in this parent "div id=byId"
            </p>
            <p>image</p>
            <p class="blog-p">we said that JS can  manipulate the elements(nodes) using their properties and methods. So in the next illustrations we’ll be  changing the node "div id=byId" font color and by doing so the property will also be passed to his children  "h1" and "p"  </p>
            <p class="blog-p">We’ll use the method getElementById to target the button id=btnId  and the div id=”byId  to make the div font change color when the button is clicked and also changing the button text to “button clicked”</p>

            <!-- question 4 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">An array and an object are variables in JavaScript and they are both a form of data collection.</p>
          <p>image</p>
          <p class="blog-p">We access data from arrays and objects in different ways. To access data in things, we use either dot or bracket notation. To get the value of the age key in our person object with both dot and bracket notation, we’d write:
          </p>
          <p>image</p>
          <p class="blog-p">We need to use the index position inside square brackets to access data from an Array. Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. For instance, if we wanted to access the third item (‘Mexico City’) in the Array example, we need to refer to it as [2].</p>

           <!-- question 5 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>  
          <p class="blog-p">A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements  that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. The statements in a function are not always executed when a page is load, so functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. When  the script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). You need to provide a name for your function in order to call that name  if you want it to perform a task later. </p>
