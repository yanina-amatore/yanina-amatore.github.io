            <p class="blog-p">
              I encountered a simple but challenging problem worth telling in FizzBuzz exercise. After watching the Sprint-4 Workshop video and the TDD examples, I was unsure how to approach writing the functions. So, I wasn’t sure where to start. 
            </p>   
            <p class="blog-p">
              I didn’t think about console.log(numberParameter) but thought instead that I needed to create it and a bunch of other extra complicated steps. I was making the exercise way more complex, so I reached for help and attended Joseph’s live class on that Kata. I felt dumb that I missed that first step of looking for the information already provided, but I was glad I got help and a kickstart in the right direction. 
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              This experience taught me how to improve by asking others to share their problem-solving skills. It felt like when I was 6yo and asked my cousin to teach me to ride a bike. He first jumped on the bike and showed me how to do it step by step, and then stood by me while I was having a try on my own. I might have needed his assistance to start, but I rode smoothly after that.

              Maybe I'd prefer the term confidently over elegantly on how I solved this problem because I practised my problem-solving techniques this time. The exercise was about Built-In Methods, and the problem was writing some code to transform the text into a sentence and capitalize each word using JavaScript, which I didn't know how to do back then.
            <p class="blog-p">
              One technique I used was reading the code error. I’ve never thought that failing a test would give me so much information about what I needed to fix or information I needed to include.  
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              Another technique, and probably my favourite, was googling the problem. I have to admit that  It felt like cheating at the beginning because I was looking for the exact answer. However,  my search evolved to the methods I  needed to use and how to fit them into my code. Bingo! Problem solved, and the next issue gets googled.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              I probably learned from solving this problem that I must trust the learning process and use the tools provided. Last week when I was introduced to JS for the same time, I panicked. But this week, after being guided on how to problem-solve and practice it, I feel more confident about how to use it. It’s one bite at a time, one problem to solve.

              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I'm using it daily, and I'm starting to get my head around improving my technique to make it less wordy. Each line still seems like a very long explanation of what I need to do in each step, but I'm confident I'll get better in time with practice. 
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Trying something:</strong> Although I'm still quite unsure of what I am doing when writing JS, I like giving it a go and drafting a solution. It is never the answer, but it allows me to see how much I understand the problem and what steps I have in mind to solve it. </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I've researched the method and even borrowed my daughter's rubber duck to explain my JS problems, but I haven't used it yet. I still have to work on the Katas stretch material, so I'm planning to tell the duck about it.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Life-saving error messages. After researching this method and learning how testing works, I used them well. I feel more confident about getting information from errors and googling when I don't understand them. Now I see them as allies to fix my code and jump to the next problem.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Console.logging: </strong>Although I thought it was simple, it took me time to see how it worked for problem-solving. I got my head around them in the Katas when I worked on the function capitalize() exercise. It helped me confirm how my string array was changing in every step, and I didn't have to guess if my code was working.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Googling</strong> It's probably the technique I used the most after pseudocode. After planning what I need to do, I look for how to do it and also Google error messages I don't understand. I believe I'm learning to choose the best sources to get answers and examples as I'm choosing to read documentation and MDZ Web Docs more than pre-made answers in Developers' blogs.

              <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>  I made some progress in that field. I've been asking questions in the Discord channels and getting help from peers. I'm glad we are not all coding newbies, and there are great knowledgeable people in Foundations ready to help.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
             <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>  Our coaches are very approachable when asked for help, and I feel confident to ask for it if needed. I've had a one-on-one session with some of them and felt supported.
            </p> 
            <p class="blog-p">
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>I'm still working on this one and battling my fixed mindset. I'm not quite sure what reflection time should look like for me. Most of the time, I stop to think after I solve something to make sure I understood what I did and hope it wasn't a stroke of luck, but I don't feel like that's enough of a reflection. It's so much new information day after day that it's hard to believe that a brief review will fix the knowledge.
