            <p class="blog-p">
              Understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity helps people know that the brain and learning capacity is malleable and can be improved and strengthened with practice.  The more time we spend practising something or thinking about it, the more connexion our brain builds, making that learning permanent.  Knowing that we can improve our abilities or compensate for limitations is uplifting.  
            </p>   
            <p class="blog-p"> 
              Personally, I want to apply this knowledge to improve my learning journey. It’s great to remember that I have the physical capability to learn no matter what my inner saboteur voice tells me. I’ve learnt that progression and building new neuron connections depend on me and that the more practice and difficulties I overcome, the stronger those connections will be.

            <h2 class="h2">High-challenge activities = increased neuroplasticity. </h2>
            <p class="blog-p">
              We can increase neuroplasticity by immersing  in rich, exciting and new experiences. These are 8 ways to increase our brain malleability:
            </p>
   
            <h3 class="h3"> #1: Find clarity:</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Knowing exactly what you want to accomplish, and more importantly, why you want to accomplish it, is foundational to making any real changes for the long-term.</p>
            
            <h3 class="h3">#2: Set meaningful goals</h3>
            <p class="blog-p"> 
              Goal setting is key to setting yourself up for lifelong learning. Of course, lifelong learning is a critical part of increasing your neuroplasticity.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              If you can partake in activities and goals that immerse the motor, auditory and visual parts of your brain, it’s like a full-body brain workout where you’re more likely to engage your corpus callosum. This increases the bridged connections between your left brain and right brain. This means you’ll become better at solving complex problems, have better coordination, and ultimately increase your neuroplasticity.
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="h3">#3: Take micro-steps</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Your secret weapon to achieving any goal. The trick is making the most minute micro-steps every day when working toward. When your brain first records changes, these initial changes in your brain are only temporary. To make lasting changes in your brain patterns and build up the most brain plasticity, you must be diligent about challenging yourself daily.</p>
            
            <h3 class="h3">#4: Adopt a growth mindset</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The main point about developing a growth mindset is that it comes with embracing challenges.
              When chasing any challenge or goal with a growth mindset, you need to seek those pitfalls and look forward to “failures” or pain points because hidden in those trying times and those annoying experiences is a treasure of growth and learning. We all have fears and avoid challenges because of our fears, but if you can shoot straight for the challenges and seek them out, that'll change everything.

                <ul class="mindset-list ei-list ">
                  <li>Self-awareness</li>
                  <li>Self-control to make value-based decisions</li>

            <p class="blog-p"> 
              This is especially important when it comes to increasing your neuroplasticity and changing the patterns in your brain. Suppose you’re living on autopilot (which most of us are). In that case, it’ll likely take extra energy to get used to awakening your prefrontal cortex, the decision-making part of your brain, before creating any new good habit.            
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              So practising mindfulness is a critical part of awakening your consciousness. Not only is this how to make good decisions and work toward filling your time with what you care about, but this conscious awakening also strengthens your neuroplasticity.  
            </p>
          
            <h3 class="h3">#6: Carefully select your circle of influence</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Allow people who align with you core values into your circle of influence and lessen the amount of people in your circle of concern.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              By spending more time with people who align with your core values, you’ll more likely create meaningful growth experiences for yourself that’ll help increase your neuroplasticity.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Surround yourself with like-minded people who will push you to focus on things like your growth, goals, health, and aligning with your values. These are the people who will help you navigate your passions and purpose.
            </p>
           
            <h3 class="h3">#7: Prioritize an exercise routine</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Exercise and neuroplasticity go hand in hand. A 2013 study conducted by Kirk Erickson and colleagues links “greater amounts of physical activity to less cortical atrophy, better brain function and enhanced cognitive function.”
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              In a way, you could call this the physical side of neuroplasticity exercise.So try to fit into your daily schedule some form of exercise routine.
            </p>
          
            <h3 class="h3">#8: Stop procrastinating</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The longer you wait to change your behavior and habits, the harder it’ll be to increase your brain plasticity. And if you stop procrastinating, your brain will be less likely to fall victim to the use it or lose it principle. A way to hack procrastination is to trick your brain into moving and acting as quickly as possible before your mind gets in the way.

                <ol class="mindset-list ei-list">
                  <li> <strong>Mel Robbins’5 Second Rule</strong> – as soon as you recognize the need to make a conscious value-driven decision, you count backward 5-4-3-2-1 and physically move to take that action. The theory behind why this works is:<i>“If you have an impulse to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill the idea.”</i>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                  <li><strong>Peter Voogd’s Decision Train</strong> – you don’t wait until you feel like doing something. Instead, you do some pre-planning and act first, decide second and feel last. Most people are unsuccessful at taking action because they do the opposite and feel first before making their decisions.</li>

            <h2 class="h2"> Developing a Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">
              People with a growth mindset believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others). They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset. These people believe their basic abilities, intelligence, and talents are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount, and that cannot be improved. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The two mindsets will affect how people learn and face difficulties in life, as fixed-minded people won’t succeed and will be far more limited than the growth mindset people. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Growth Mindset strategies that I’m planning to apply in my learning journey.</h3>
            <h4 class="h4"><span class=" h4-sub">1. See your challenges as opportunities</span></h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              I’ll work on re-shaping my thoughts so that when I face difficulties, I don’t see them as obstacles or setbacks that I dread. Instead,  I’ll try to view them as opportunities to overcome something difficult and grow as a result. The more complex the challenge, the greater chance of learning and growth.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="h4"><span class=" h4-sub">2. Reflect each day on what you’ve failed at (and learned from)</span> </h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Although I want to reward myself for my daily successes, it’s crucial to reflect on the areas I didn’t do so well. The point’s not to dwell or beat up on me but to recognize and lock in the learning.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="h4"> <span class=" h4-sub">3. Prioritize learning over seeking approval.</span></h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              This is a key point to cultivating a growth mindset, but it took me a while to understand. When you seek other people’s approval, you miss the goal of learning and growing and cannot afford to be wrong. We start taking being right as our goal rather than learning comfortably with the daily failures that come with stretching.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="h4"><span class=" h4-sub">4. Identify opportunities to celebrate the success of others</span></h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              When others around me succeed, I’ll celebrate them! What’s more  I’ll get curious about what made them successful and ask them about it Connecting with these like-minded people  will help me understand what actions they took and how they approached the challenge to get there.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="h4"><span class=" h4-sub">5.Choose learning well over learning fast.</span></h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              This goes back to focusing on the process of learning instead of the result. Learning isn't something that can be rushed. I have to go through some mistakes to truly find success, and none of that will come easy or quickly.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="h4"><span class=" h4-sub">6. Start using the word <strong>"yet"</strong> more often</span></h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              This is probably my favourite one. Whenever I catch myself thinking, "I'm not very good at this," add the word "yet": "I'm not very good at this yet."
