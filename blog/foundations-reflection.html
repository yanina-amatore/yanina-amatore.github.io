            <h2 class="h2">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">
              I’ve learnt that I have quite a fixed mindset, affecting my learning. The way I’ve been facing difficulties and challenges fits with Dr Decks fix minded people’s description, but I can work on that and change it. 
              <p class="blog-p">
                My brain is physiologically prepared to change and expand, as neuroplasticity explains. The way to create those new connections is through repetition and practice. It’s not about being a natural, it’s about brain exercise.   
              </p> 
              <p class="blog-p">
                I can develop an impressive learning plan and work-process framework, but implementing them will bring success. Even though I made those, I’ve been running like a headless chicken quite some times during foundations, so I’ve learned that I have to stick to my plans and trust the process.

              <h2 class="h2">What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
              
              <p class="blog-p">
                Self-awareness brings knowledge about your strengths and weaknesses, which is essential to finding which learning style fits you better.  It also shows your emotional intelligence, which is key to working with others and landing a job in the tech industry.                  
              </p> 
                
              <p class="blog-p">
                Empathy is vital in learning and programming. As students, we’d have a more pleasant experience if we show it to others but most importantly to ourselves. 
              </p> 
              <p class="blog-p">
                Coding involves continual debugging and remixing, which can help us understand that failure is essential to learning and help develop empathy. We can practice empathy by identifying others' problems, creatively developing solutions, designing the user interface and creating the user experience are the skills of coding that enable us to see, understand and feel the world from others' perspectives.

              <h2 class="h2">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h2>
              
              <p class="blog-p">
                It was probably how well each sprint's core content was planned. I felt the core information was manicured to fit what we needed as new programming students.                 
              </p> 
                
              <p class="blog-p">
                I was also pleasantly surprised by the mindfulness exercises and the advice to implement them in our daily life. It felt like you were not only preparing us for Bootcamp days but to cope with our future career path.

              <h2 class="h2">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
              
              <p class="blog-p">
                Although I praise its benefits, the most challenging aspect was practising mindfulness. I’ve struggled to keep up with my daily meditation practice through Sprints 4 and 5, and I’m still working on it. It’s not because I don’t consider it beneficial but because I get anxious about falling behind.                
              </p>                                           
            </section>
            <section class="section-5 ">
              <h2 class="h2">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
              
              <p class="blog-p">
                I’m glad you do, which is why I picked studying at EDA.  As I mentioned, each sprint's core content made it possible for me to do well in the tech part. It helped build my confidence and introduced me to the tools to face new challenges every week.                
              </p> 
            </section>  
            
            <section class="section-6 ">
              <h2 class="h2">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? </h2>
              
              <p class="blog-p">
                There were sprints in which I wanted to jump to the Tech part before completing the Core one, but it was not because I felt it was a waste of time. I believe it was because  I was hungry for learning and practising code.  Still, I listened to my facilitator and completed the sprint as directed, realising that it was organised like that for a good reason.                
              </p> 
              
              <p class="blog-p ">
                I don’t believe you need to alter the core content to fit more programming. I still haven’t gone through Bootcamp, but I feel that Foundations Core content will be vital to survive it.
