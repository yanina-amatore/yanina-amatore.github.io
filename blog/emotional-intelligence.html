          <!-- question 1 -->
          <h2 class="h2">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">Your emotional intelligence  generally refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior. In general, if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:
          </p>
          <ul class="ei-list">
            <li>identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
            <li>empathize with other people</li>
            <li>adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations</li>
            <li>control your impulses</li>
            <li>withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
            <li>resolve conflicts with others</li>
            <li>communicate effectively</li>
          </ul>
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <h2 class="h2">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expressions. It is acquired and could be improved. Conversely, IQ (intelligence quotient)  is an ability you are born with. It refers to your intellectual capacity and ability to use logic to solve problems and plan and strategise.</p> 
         
          <!-- question 3 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Why is it important?</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows you to empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially aware. 
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">EI is vital when dealing with stressful situations like conflict, change, and obstacles.
          It will also help to navigate school or workplace social complexities effectively, lead and motivate others and excel in your career.</p>
