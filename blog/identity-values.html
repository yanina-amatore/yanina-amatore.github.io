          <!-- question 1 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">A time I had to make an ethical decision could be when I asked a prospective employer for a time extension to sign their contract because I wanted to wait for my Dev Academy interview outcome. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">Before Dev Academy applications opened, I told a good friend of mine that I was interested in getting into IT, which she thought would be an excellent fit for me. Her dad works in a local branch of an IT Company, and she set us up for a meeting so I could get some insight and advice about the industry.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">I might have made a good impression because he wanted me to get a job in his company. He stressed how expensive studying is and that I would access the company's IT training resources for free by working for them. I have to say that his speech was very appealing after the six-month unpaid maternity leave. Still, I wanted to consider it because I was committed to applying to Dev Academy.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Knowing myself, I needed a Plan B in case I didn't get into EDA, so I interviewed for a role. I thought interviewing for this IT Company would be excellent practice for my upcoming Dev interview and that if I didn't get a place at EDA, I would have options. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">My Integrity value was tested when they offered me an admin job. As I was still waiting for my EDA interview date, I didn't want to make a choice yet. So, I asked my prospective employer for a week extension to sign the contract knowing they could drop the offer. Some people suggested I sign it anyway and then quit if I got in DEV. However, that didn't resonate with me. I felt distressed because I didn't want to make a wrong decision, but what they suggested was unfair and unkind to me. I knew in my core that the more empathetic and fair thing was to be honest, and tell them about my situation. I thought that 'honesty is always the best policy ' and,  after all, if they consider me a good candidate, they might still hire me. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">The story has a happy end because I felt true to myself, sticking to my values. Although The company dropped the job offer, I got accepted at Dev Academy, and I'm sharing this story with you.</p> 
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">Most of my values come from my parents and my religious upbringing, which was central in forging the base for my kindness and integrity values. However, in my early twenties, I opted to be more open-minded. I had my religious values checked for things considered controversial for my faith. I found that the values taught were correct but didn't include everyone, which was unacceptable for me. Since then, I've been trying to better myself, keep an open- mind and make sure I have some downtime to check my values and how I live by them every so often. After all, now I am now a mom, and I'd love that when my daughter thinks of kindness, integrity and empathy, she could think about me.</p>
          <!-- question 3 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
          <p class="blog-p"><em>Strength: people-oriented, loyal, friendly, hard-working, great-team player, curious, enthusiastic, good natured.</em></p>
          <p class="blog-p"><em>Weakness/limitations: Avoid confrontation, risk-taking and assertiveness, unfocused, disorganized</em></p>
          <p class="blog-p">After chewing on the evidence I recollected, I concluded that the strengths and limitations listed below could affect my learning and career in the described ways.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">I believe that being friendly and a good nature person will significantly benefit me during this studying journey and my future career development. I can reach out to other people for help in case I need it. People will probably feel comfortable around me and want to collaborate with me.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-p">My main limitations are associated with quickly losing focus and being unorganized. I must purposefully work on this daily during my learning journey and future career to set myself up for success. My primary tool these days is timeboxing. I'm also finding it very useful to keep track of my chores and ensure I spend quality time with my baby daughter.
          </p>
          <!-- question 4 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">This exercise is of great help to me because it makes me think ahead about how I'll deal with obstacles utilising my strengths.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">I'm one of those who quickly loses confidence when hitting a wall with a problem, so I plan to change perspective. Try seeing the problem from a different angle and use my curiosity and interest in learning how things work to explore new solutions. I'll try keeping in mind that I'm hitting a wall because I have yet something new to learn, and when I do it, it'll be rewarding.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Another learning obstacle could be my shyness to ask questions. Although I have people skills and can talk to everyone, I feel silly when reaching out for help. In my head, the problem is evident to everyone else, and I'm the only one not getting it. However, this 1st sprint has helped me to see how important it is to ask about my doubts, not only for myself but for others like me that are shy to ask. My empathy and team-player skills will remind me that I'll be helping others too.</p>
         
           <!-- question 5 -->
          <h2 class="h2">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>  
          <p class="blog-p">When I worked for the Department of Corrections as an admin, my team and I had to organise the office move. I was swapped in my personal work, but as a team player, I wanted to do my part and help complete the task. </p>
          <p class="blog-p">The problem some of us ran into was multitasking so much that it was hard to tick something off our list. This created some group tension as we had deadlines to meet, and things were not happening. I remember there was poor team communication and no daily updates, so I knew I had to devise a strategy.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">My plan was to divide and conquer. I couldn't do it all at once, so I'd start small with the easier and quicker tasks and then move to more time-consuming ones. Then, I changed my multitasking approach to a single job at a time, which helped me move faster through my list. Also, I took the first step of communicating my progress to my team so they would feel more comfortable sharing theirs. After all, we were all struggling and starting the conversation brought us closer.</p>
          <p class="blog-p">Reflecting on this experience, I think I did pretty well during that challenging time. However,  it would have been of great help utilising some of the strategies I've learnt during Sprint 1. Timeboxing and the Pomodoro techniques are my favourites so far. I'm impressed by how much I can achieve with my time following their rules. I'm committed to implementing them in my learning and working journey</p>
